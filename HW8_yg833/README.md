# Homework 8
## Assignment 1
For this assignment, I worked by myself to make a plot using a dataset I found interesting from the NYC Open Data portal. I decided to look at the incidences of graffiti reported. I wanted to see if certain / areas in NYC had more graffiti than others.

Fig 1: Shows a map of NYC and each point represents a location where graffiti was reported. The color intensity shows how many times graffiti may have been reported at that location.
