# Homework 5

This was week 5 of the course. There were 2 assignments for the evening session. For both assignments, I only worked by myself. There were parts where I looked up help on the web. This was particularly true for the unzip file for Assignment 1. I ran into a bit of issues with unzipping a folder. 

## Assignment 1
This was mainly using the functions in pandas using the skeleton notebook provided by Dr. Bianco

## Assignment 2
This was mainly following up and cleaning the notes from the SQL course.
