# Homework 4

This was week 4 of the course. There were multiple assignments as part of Homework 4. I collaborated with a number of classmates on the homework assignments as follow:

* Collaborated with Sam Falk (sjf374) on all three assignments.
* Additionally, worked collaboratively with Qin Yu(qg412) on assignment 2 and 3.

## Assignment 1

For this assignment, Sam and I started with the skeleton notebook provided by Dr. Bianco and followed her directions: https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/tree/master/HW4_fb55

The assignment was to: 
* GENERATE  100 samples of different sizes Ns in the range of (N>10 & N<2000) for 5 different distributions all with the same population mean:
    ** a _Normal_, a _Poisson_, a _Binomial_, a _Chi-Squared_ distribution, and 1 more of your choice.

* For each distribution, we had to plot the sample mean (dependent var.) against the sample size N (independent var.)

* As part of the comments for the plots, we have to describe it in terms of the Central Limit Thereom

* Lastly, we had to plot all the sample means together and fit to a Gaussian.

This assignment was rather challenging for me. So in working with Sam, we talked a lot about what the plot should look like. This was particularly true for the lognormal distribution at the end. For example, we read the wiki on the lognormal distribution to understand that a random varaible is lognormally distributed if the logarithm of the random variable is normally distributed. After working on the assignment together, we cleaned up our code/ notebooks separately.


## Assignment 2

For this assignment, we had to use the Citibike data set. And we referenced Dr. Bianco's sample notebook on how she formulated her hypothesis using the gender variable. 
referenced here: https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/HW4_fb55/citibikes_gender.ipynb

We then picked the time period to explore, formulated a null and alternative hypothesis.

After talking through what we wanted to look at we discussed the ways to clean up the data especially regarding the date values. 

## Assignment 3

This assignment was a continuation of something that we looked at in class. In our homework group, we actually started with this assignment first. 
We also referenced Dr. Bianco's slides from class for this assignment and used the txt sample data set provided.
